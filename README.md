Pariticipated in the Embedded Security Challenge (ESC) as part of [CSAW 2023](https://www.csaw.io/). CSAW is founded by the department of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and is the most comprehensive student-run cyber security event in the world, featuring international competitions, workshops, and industry events.

## Challenge Results
- ***Stood 3rd position overall and in CSAW-India***
- ***One of the 20 teams qualified for the finals***

## Challenge Summary
ESC focuses on side channel attacks (SCA) on cyber-physical systems (CPS). Cyber-physical systems are used by hundreds of industries and in many critical infrastructure systems. If these CPSs are not properly setup they can leak information even if they are using cryptographically secure software. Teams will investigate a range of SCAs on an Arduino Uno based CPS running several firmware that expose various side channels. 

The event comprises a qualification and a competition phase where teams will be able to explore several variations of a CPS and exploit side channels they find while suggesting mitigations for the found exploits.
